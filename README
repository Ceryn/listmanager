listmanager : A curses based list manager for the terminal.

Used to handle lists of any sort. Useful for todo lists or whatever. Well. Probably not very useful to most people.

Much the same can be done easily enough in vim, except it lets you mark items as urgent and shows you when the item was last updated.

STATUS:
This project is only half-way completed. Still has many issues. More information will follow at some later date.
